    The purpose of this page is to help you, that's right, you. We wanted a site that was easy to use and would let you know have idea of where you would like to live when you move here. Assuming you're looking here
    because you want to move here. This site was created so all you have to do it know where you are going to work, how you prefer to travel across the city, what kind of area you like to live in and what your budget is. With
    this information we are happy to point you in the correct direction!!
  </p>
<br>
  <p> As creators of this fabulous site, we decided to provide this 'service' because we know what it is like to move countries/cities, be that moving
    from Atlantis to King's Landing or moving from Paris to Madrid. Since this site is in English, we are aiming to help people move from an english speaking country
    to Madrid. However if you are bi or tri or in genreal super talented and multilingual then that's just a-ok. Two of the creators of this site have lived in Madrid
    so they kind of know what an earth we are on about. However... doesn't everyone.. we try.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p> So to end the ramblings or whatever tangent we appear to be on on this about us page... let us tell  you about Madrid.
<h2> About Madrid </h2>
  <br>

  <br>
  <p>Since this is a website, we cannot just give you a beautiful slideshow about Madrid...like this cool kid here
